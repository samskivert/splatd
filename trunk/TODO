- Minimize code duplication in plugin parseOptions() methods by extending  
  ZConfig. 
- Plugins for cleaning up MediaWiki and Bugzilla databases when accounts are
  deleted.
- Make ./setup.py install also install man pages and perhaps xhtml 
  documentation to a sensible place.
- Plugin to add users to password and group files, in case LDAP is not used
  directly for authorization. This could be useful in cases where authentication
  is handled purely by e.g. Kerberos or SSH keys, user and group information is
  kept in an LDAP directory, and it is desirable to keep the system accessible 
  when LDAP servers are unreachable. Unfortunately this probably cannot be done
  in a cross platform way. The plugin could call pw(8) on FreeBSD, dscl(1) on
  Mac OS X, and perhaps useradd(8)/usermod(8)/etc. on Linux.

These items are more like a wishlist than actual planned features:

- Allow customization of parent directory and name of ssh authorized keys file
  in sshPublicKeys plugin.
- Allow customizing of the type of file created for mail forwarding in
  mailForwardingAddress plugin, e.g. .qmail instead of .forward.
- Path delimeters are hard-coded as / in many plugins. We may want to change 
  this to something more portable someday.
