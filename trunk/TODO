- Plugins for cleaning up mediawiki and bugzilla databases when accounts are
  deleted.
- Make ./setup.py install also install man pages and perhaps xhtml 
  documentation to a sensible place.

These items are more like a wishlist than actual planned features:

- Allow customization of parent directory and name of ssh authorized keys file
  in sshPublicKeys plugin.
- Allow customizing of the type of file created for mail forwarding in
  mailForwardingAddress plugin, e.g. .qmail instead of .forward.
- Path delimeters are hard-coded as / in many plugins. We may want to change 
  this to something more portable someday.
