This contains the debian subdirectory that is added to the source directory of
splat to make debian/ubuntu source and binary packages for splat. To build these
packages, just run make after making whatever changes you wanted to in
debian/foo. You may need to increment the version number and/or change the key
ID used in the makefile. To check the built packages with lintian and linda,
make check. make clean will clean up everything (including any packages you may
have built).
