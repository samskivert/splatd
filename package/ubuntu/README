This contains the debian subdirectory that is added to the source directory of
splat to make debian/ubuntu source and binary packages for splat. To build these
packages, just run make after making whatever changes you wanted to in
debian/foo. If you want to upload the packages, make sign to add gpg signatures.
You may need to increment the version number and/or change the key ID used in
the makefile when building or signing. To check the built packages with lintian
and linda, make check. make clean will clean up everything (including any
packages you may have built).
