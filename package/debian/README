This contains the debian subdirectory that is added to the source directory of
splat to make debian/ubuntu source and binary packages for splat. To build these
packages, do the following:

1) Get a splat release tarball, and rename it to splatd_version.orig.tar.gz.

2) Extract the tarball (but keep it there), and svn export the debian directory
into your extracted splat directory.

3) Change to the splat source directory and make the changes you wish to make.
Please only make changes to files in the debian/ subdir here; changes to the
splat code itself should not be done only within this package. If debian/ubuntu
specific changes need to be made to the code, you could use a debian/patches
subdirectory and the appropriate debhelper scripts or changes to the
debian/rules file.

4) Update the debian/changelog file to reflect your changes and bump the version
number. Any released new package should always have the version
number bumped. If the same splat release is being used, just change the package
version number (e.g. change 1.0-0ubuntu1 to 1.0-0ubuntu2). dch is a
helpful tool for updating the changelog.

5) Build source and binary packages with dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot. You may
also need to supply your gpg key ID with the -k option, if you want to sign the
package and dpkg-buildpackage can't figure your ID out on its own.

6) Optional: make sure the package is valid by running linda and lintian on the
generated .changes file, and try building it in a pbuilder chroot by running
pbuilder build on the .dsc file (if you have pbuilder all set up already)

7) Upload your source and/or binary packages somewhere so other people can use
them.

For example:

mkdir /tmp/splat
cd /tmp/splat
wget http://dpw.threerings.net/projects/splat/splat-1.0.tar.gz
mv splat-1.0.tar.gz splatd_1.0.orig.tar.gz
tar zxf splatd_1.0.orig.tar.gz
svn export svn+ssh://src.earth.threerings.net/splat/package/debian/debian /tmp/splat/splat-1.0/debian
cd splat-1.0
# make changes you want, including updating debian/changelog
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -k01ACE113
cd ..
lintian splatd_1.0-1_i386.changes
linda splatd_1.0-1_i386.changes
sudo pbuilder update
sudo pbuilder build splatd_1.0-1.dsc
