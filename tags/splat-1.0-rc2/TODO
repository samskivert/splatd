- Support user account deletion: archive mail and home directory, then delete
  after a certain amount of time.
- Plugins for cleaning up mediawiki and bugzilla databases when accounts are
  deleted.

These items are more like a wishlist than actual planned features:

- Allow customization of parent directory and name of ssh authorized keys file
  in sshPublicKeys plugin.
- Allow customizing of the type of file created for mail forwarding in
  mailForwardingAddress plugin, e.g. .qmail instead of .forward.
- In homeDirectory, mailForwardingAddress, and sshPublicKeys plugins, path
  delimeters are hard-coded as /. We may want to change this to something more
  portable someday.
